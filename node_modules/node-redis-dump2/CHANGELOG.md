# CHANGELOG

## Version 0.5.0
* start rewrite code
* added new import/export type "dump-base64" which uses redis "dump" command. The binary data from the dump are base64
  encoded to be able to safe them as string into a file. This allows im/export of complex hashes or strings with line 
  breaks and so similar

## Version 0.4.0
* bump version to have different number as original package (if 0.3.0 might be release there with partial fixes only)

## Version 0.3.0
* forked from original author with some pathes applied
* switch from redis to ioredis library
* applied all other patches from Redis-Commander that are missing
* renamed to node-redis-dump2 and published on npm

## Version 0.2.1
latest released version from original author (node-redis-dump)
